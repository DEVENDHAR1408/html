    <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web pages. It's a markup language used to structure and define the content of a web page, telling a web browser how to display text, images, links, and other multimedia elements. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a set of tags and elements that define the content and structure. 
Here's a more detailed look:
Purpose:
HTML provides the structure for web pages, organizing content into headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more. 
Markup Language:
It's a markup language, meaning it uses tags to annotate text and other content, telling the browser how to display it. </p>
